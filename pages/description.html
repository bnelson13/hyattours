<!-- The Ferry Building -->

<p>
	The San Francisco Ferry Building is a terminal for ferries that travel across the San Francisco Bay, a foodhall and an
	office building. Designed in 1892 by American architect A. Page Brown in the Beaux Arts style, the ferry building was
	completed in 1898.
</p>

<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The Grand Nave as it appared in 1898</span>
<p>
	At its opening, it was the largest project undertaken in the city up to that time. Brown designed the clock tower
	after the 12th-century Giralda bell tower in Seville, Spain, and the entire length of the building on both frontages
	is based on an arched arcade.
</p>
<p>
	It was so well built, with it's arched arcades, that it survived both the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes with very little
	damage. Today is serves Ferry's from Sausalito, Larkspur, Alameda, and Vallejo.

<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The Ferry Building after the 1906 Earthquake</span>
<p>
	Before the Golden Gate or Bay Bridges were completed, ferry boats were the only way travelers and commuters could
	reach the city except by way of the Peninsula, a much longer voyage. At this time it was the 2nd busiest transit
	terminal in the world, second only to Charing Cross in London. When the bridges were built the Ferry building was
	rarely used and fell into disrepair. It was converted to standard office space.
</p>
<p>
	Than, in the 1950s the Embarcadero Freeway was built which passed directly in front of the Ferry Building but when
	this was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake it was decided to remove this freeway altogether and a beautiful
	waterfront boulevard was developed.
</p>

<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">Embaradero Freeway limiting access to the Ferry Building</span>
<p>
	In 1999 an extensive restoration was commenced and the Ferry Building opened 4 years later. The ground floor of the
	building was redesigned as a marketplace featuring about 50 restaurants, retail shops and food purveyors, most of
	which are open seven days a week. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays there is an expansive outdoor Ferry Plaza
	Farmer's Market.

<!-- 343 Sansome -->

<p>
	A landmark building, 343 Sansome was designed by John Galen Howard, the founder of the U.C. School of Architecture and
	constructed in 1908. In 1929, five stories were added and the building was decorated in an elegant art deco design. In
	1990, a 15-story tower was added adjacent to the initial 13-storied tower and the two buildings were combined.

<!-- Transamerica Pyramid -->

<p>
	Construction on the Transamerica Pyrimid began in 1969 and the building was finished in 1972. At height of 853 feet
	and 48 floors it was the tallest skyscraper in San Francisco from its construction until 2017 when the Salesforce
	Tower was completed.
</p>
<p><img class="modal-stop-inner-img" src="../img/transamerica-pyramid/historical-1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">Construction on the Pyramid in 1969</span>
<p>
	Despite it's now famous design it was originally faced heavy opposition. The land use and zoning restrictionns for the
	land it was built on limited the number of square feet of office that could be built. The architect, William Pereira,
	designed it as a tall, four-sided pyramid with two 'wings' to accommodate an elevator and stairs.
</p>
<p>
	It originally housed an observation deck, but this was closed down after 9/11 and is now a virtual observation deck
	with live camera's that guests can control from the lobby. In 2020 it was sold for 650 million dollars.
</p>

<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The hollow glass room at the very top</span>
<p>
	The spire on the top of the building is actually hollow and is lined with a 100 foot steel railway at a 60 degree
	angle and then steel ladders. These allow access to the red aircraft warning light on the top of the pyramid.
</p>
<p>
	Today the building houses offices for Merrill Lynch, Mars Inc, Pantheon Ventures, TSG Consumer Partners, Greenhill &
	Co, and others.

	Adjacent to the building is a half-acre public space with redwood trees transplanted from the Santa Cruz mountains, as
	well as a fountain and pond with bronze sculptures. Don't miss the placard for San Francisco's famous canine's
	'Bummer' and 'Lazarus'
</p>

<!-- Old Chinese Telephone Exchange -->

<p>
	Before cellphone and touch tone land lines callers couldn't directly dial numbers, they had to call up an exchange and
	an operator would manually patch their call through. The Old Chinese Telephone Exchange was one such building, though
	unrivaled in it's beauty by other exchanges.
</p>
<p><img class="modal-stop-inner-img" src="../img/telephone-exchange/historical-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The original building destroyed by fire in 1906</span>
<p>
	It opened in 1896 but was destroyed by fire during the 1906 Earthquake. It was rebuilt in 1909 and served up to 3000
	phones. The exchange was staffed with 40 operators, who had to be able to recall from memory each of these numbers.
	They had to know the names, numbers, address for each of the lines and often had to speak in multiple dialects.
</p>
<p>
	In the 1960's it was a popular tourist attraction, and greyhound buses would pull up to the window to gawk at the
	stylish femaile operators, clad in embroidered silk dresses.
</p>
<p><img class="modal-stop-inner-img" src="../img/telephone-exchange/historical-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">Operators hard at work</span>
<p>
	The operators were not paid very well, indeed they fought against a 7-day work week and low wages. But it was a
	tight-knit group, many people were related and often got the job through friends or family.
</p>
<p>
	The exchange shut down in 1949 after technological advances negated the need for manual operators. It now houses a
	bank servicing local the local community.
</p>
<p><img class="modal-stop-inner-img" src="../img/telephone-exchange/historical-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The job required a lot of memorization</span>

<!-- Dragon's Gate -->

<p>
	In 1953 the US placed an embargo on China after they entered into the Korean War. In an effor to improve local
	business the Chinese Chamber of Commerce held an essay contest for suggestions. The winner proposed an authentic
	archway at Bush & Grant streets.
</p>
<p><img class="modal-stop-inner-img" src="../img/dragon-gate/historical-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The Gate under construction </span>
<p>
	In 1969, after years of funding issues, Taiwan donated materials to build the Gate. The then Mayor of San Francisco
	George Christopher held a design competition and 3 Chinese-American landscape architects won the competition with the
	current design, which is in the traditional Chinese pailou style.
</p>
<p>
	The gate is gaurded by a male and female lion on either side. The male lion has his paw atop a stone, symbolically
	guarding the the structure, while the female lion has her paw on a juvenile lion, symbolically guarding the occupants
	within the city.
</p>
<p><img class="modal-stop-inner-img" src="../img/dragon-gate/historical-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The male and female lions guarding the entrance</span>
<p>
	Atop the gate the fish symbolize prosperity and the dragons symbolize power and fertility. Between them is an orb
	representing the Earth.
</p>
<p>
	The signs above the largest portal for vehicles reads 'All under heavan is for the good of the people', the Western
	portal sign reads 'Trust & Peace', while the Eastern portal reads 'Respect & Love.

<span class="modal-stop-inner-img-caption">The striking exterior draws people in</span>
<p>
	It has since housed a number of tenants but has always made it tricky for store managers to contend with the ongoing
	parade of tourists, keen to see the impressive interior.
</p>
<p>
	The constant influx of tourists, though, allowed the the building to gain Landmark Status from the City of San
	Francisco in 2016

	The distinctive arched brickwork was designed to lure passers-by off the street and into the airy interior of the
	shop. The interior is bright and airy, aided by the beautiful bubbled cieling.
</p>
<p>
	The curved ramp is the most notable part of the space and is a prototype for the ramp in the interior of the Solomon
	R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City which Frank Lloyd Wright designed in 1952.
